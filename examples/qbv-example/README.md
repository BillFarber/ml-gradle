This project shows an example of how MarkLogic 11 QBVs can be generated from an Optic
query and loaded into a schemas database from src/main/ml-schemas/qbv. 

Note that in order for this to work, a schemas database must be created and the content-database.json file must specify
that schema database. This example is already setup to meet those requirements with a schemas-database.json file.
